# H2O Architecture #

## What is H2O? ##

H2O is open source in-memory distributed machine learning platform with enterprise level modeling and scoring functionalities. H2O can on a standalong machine like Windows, OSX or Linux OS or it can run on distributed systems like Hadoop and Spark. It can ingest data from various enterprise endpoints and H2O models can score at sub-second level on either one machine or hundreds of machines. 

Following are key detais:
   - H2O is open source means everything happens in H2O is publically available to learn and see through code (no black box)
   - "In-memory" means all the processing happes into memory so it is very fast
   - "Distributed" means you can run H2O on several (hundreds) nodes which helps enterprises to do machine learning on very large amount of data
 - Enterprise grade machine learing
   - H2O support various enterprise level data sources i.e. NFS, S3, S3N, HDFS, RDBMS (through JDBC driver), noSQL
   - H2O support various data format i.e. avro, parquet, excel, json, csv, svmlite, ARRF, ORC
 - Enterprise grade scoring sub-system
   - H2O models can be scored with H2O (in-cluster) and outside H2O (out-cluster)
   - In-cluster scoring is done through H2O binary model
   - Out-cluster scoring is done through MOJO and POJO

## How it works? ##


## What you can do with H2O? ##
 - Get started with minimal effort and investment. 
 - Super fast machine learning, all in memory.
 - Make better predictions. 
 - Use algorithms and the processing power you need to analyze bigger data sets, more models, and more variables.
 - H2O is an extensible open source platform that offers the most pragmatic way to put big data to work for your business.
 - With H2O, you can work with your existing languages and tools. 
 - Further, you can extend the platform seamlessly into your Hadoop environments.
 - Score without H2O in any environment where Java runs
