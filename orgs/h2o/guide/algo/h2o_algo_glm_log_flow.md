# H2O GLM (Generialized Linear Regression) - Logistic Regression in FLOW #

### Datasets ###
The dataset used in this example can be obtained from here:
 - [house_price_train.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Avkash/mldl/master/data/house_price_train.csv)
 - [housr_price_test.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Avkash/mldl/master/data/house_price_test.csv)

Note: Use "wget" and above links to pull the the data locally or use the URL above directly to load data into H2O.

Please use the exact same example as decribed for Linear regression in FLOW [here](https://github.com/Avkash/mldl/blob/master/orgs/h2o/guide/algo/h2o_algo_glm_flow.md) and just make the following change:

### Setting GLM family to BINOMIAL for Logistic Regression ###
