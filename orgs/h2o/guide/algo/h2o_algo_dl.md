# Deep Learning (Neural Networks) # 

H2Oâ€™s Deep Learning is based on a multi-layer [feedforward artificial neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network) that is trained with stochastic gradient descent using back-propagation. The network can contain a large number of hidden layers consisting of neurons with tanh, rectifier, and maxout activation functions. Advanced features such as adaptive learning rate, rate annealing, momentum training, dropout, L1 or L2 regularization, checkpointing, and grid search enable high predictive accuracy. Each compute node trains a copy of the global model parameters on its local data with multi-threading (asynchronously) and contributes periodically to the global model via model averaging across the network.
