# AutoML in H2O #

H2Oâ€™s AutoML cis used for automating the machine learning workflow, including full automated training and tuning of many models based a user provided time in seconds. AutoML also supports performance metric-based stopping criteria for the AutoML process insted of given time limit.

H2O AutoML interface is designed to have as few parameters as possible so that all the user needs to do is point to their dataset, identify the response column and optionally specify a time constraint, a maximum number of models constraint, and early stopping parameters.
