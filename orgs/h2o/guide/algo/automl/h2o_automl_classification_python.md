# H2O AutoML Classification in Python #

H2O AutoML interface is designed to have as few parameters as possible so that all the user needs to do is point to their dataset, identify the response column and optionally specify a time constraint, a maximum number of models constraint, and early stopping parameters.

## Dataset ##
The dataset used in this example can be obtained from here:
 - [titanic_list.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Avkash/mldl/master/data/titanic_list.csv)

Note: Use "wget" and above links to pull the the data locally or use the URL above directly to load data into H2O.
