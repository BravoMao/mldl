# H2O GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine) - Multinomial Classification in R #

When you pass response columns as categorical or enum and it has 3 or more classes, the h2O GBM algorithm builds Multinomial Classification Model. 

## Datasets ##
The dataset used in this example can be obtained from here:
 - [iris.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Avkash/mldl/master/data/iris.csv)

Note: Use "wget" and above links to pull the the data locally or use the URL above directly to load data into H2O.
