# Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) # 

Gradient Boosting Machine (for Regression and Classification) is a forward learning ensemble method. The guiding heuristic is that good predictive results can be obtained through increasingly refined approximations. H2Oâ€™s GBM sequentially builds regression trees on all the features of the dataset in a fully distributed way - each tree is built in parallel.

You can learn more about GBM in H2O [here](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/gbm.html).
