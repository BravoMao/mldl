# Anomaly Detection with H2O Deep Learning Auto Encoder in R #

High-dimensional data can be converted to low-dimensional codes by training a multilayer neural network with a small central layer to reconstruct high-dimensional input vectors. This kind of neural network is named Autoencoder.

H2O uses Deep Learning framework to develop an anomaly detection demonstration using a deep autoencoder. 

## Dataset used in this Sample ##

The dataset is an ECG time series of heartbeats and the goal is to determine which heartbeats are outliers. The training data (20 “good” heartbeats) and the test data (training data with 3 “bad” heartbeats appended for simplicity) can be downloaded directly into the H2O cluster, as shown below. Each row represents a single heartbeat.
