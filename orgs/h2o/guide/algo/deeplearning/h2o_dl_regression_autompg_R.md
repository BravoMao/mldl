# H2O Deep Learning - Linear Regression in Python # 

H2O Deep Learning successfully perform linear regression when the response column/feature is numeric based on Neural Network mode. 

## Dataset ##
The dataset used in this example can be obtained from here:
 - [auto_mpg.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Avkash/mldl/master/data/auto_mpg.csv)

Note: Use "wget" and above links to pull the the data locally or use the URL above directly to load data into H2O.
