# H2O Word2vec in Python #

The Word2vec algorithm takes a text corpus as an input and produces the word vectors as output. The algorithm first creates a vocabulary from the training text data and then learns vector representations of the words. The vector space can include hundreds of dimensions, with each unique word in the sample corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in the space. In addition, words that share similar contexts in the corpus are placed in close proximity to one another in the space.
