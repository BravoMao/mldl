# H2O Grid (Hyperparameter) Search for GBM in Python #

Hyperparameter Optimization is the process of setting of all combinations of values for these knobs is called the hyperparameter space. We'd like to find a set of hyperparameter values which gives us the best model for our data in a reasonable amount of time. This process is called hyperparameter optimization.

## Dataset ##
The dataset used in this example can be obtained from here:
 - [house_price_train.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Avkash/mldl/master/data/house_price_train.csv)
 - [house_price_test.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Avkash/mldl/master/data/house_price_test.csv)

Note: Use "wget" and above links to pull the the data locally or use the URL above directly to load data into H2O.
