# H2O GLM (Generialized Linear Regression) - Logistic Regression in Scala # 

H2O GLM successfully perform logistic regression when the response feature has either 0/1 binary values or only 2-class categorical values. You just need to set GLM Family to "Binomial" to build the logistic regression model. 

## Dataset ##
The dataset used in this example can be obtained from here:
 - [prostate.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Avkash/mldl/master/data/prostate.csv)

Note: Use "wget" and above links to pull the the data locally or use the URL above directly to load data into H2O.
