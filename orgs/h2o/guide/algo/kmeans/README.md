# K-Means Algorithm in H2O #

H2O has 3 key unsupervised algorithms implemented, i.e. K-Means, PCA and GLRM. The K-means clustering algorithm tries to find structures in the data without using any labels or target values. Clustering partitions a set of observations into separate groupings such that an observation in a given group is more similar to another observation in the same group than to another observation in a different group. You can learn more about K-Means in H2O [here](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/k-means.html).
