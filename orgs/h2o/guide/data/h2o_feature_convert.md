When you get dataset summary in FLOW you will be able to convert specific feature to enum or numeric by selecting proper action from the "Action" column of dataset summary view. For numeric, string and other columns you can convert them to enum using "convert to enum" action. Also for enum columnds you can convert back to numeric using "convert to numeric" action.
