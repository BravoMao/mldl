# Feature Engineering #

H2O does not have a builtin capabability to perform feature engineering so this topic is just a collection of bunch of articles and libraries in R and Python to show how a great features can be created for an H2O Dataframe.

## Libraries ##
 - [FeatureTools: Auto Feature Engineering](https://github.com/Featuretools/featuretools)
 - [boruta: Feature Selection Library in Python](https://m2.icm.edu.pl/boruta/)
