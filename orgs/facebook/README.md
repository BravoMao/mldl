### [StarSpace](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Starspace) ###
StarSpace is a library for efficient learning of entity representations from relations among collections of discrete entities.

In the general case, it embeds objects of different types into a vectorial embedding space, hence the star ('*') and space in the name, and in that space compares them against each other. It learns to rank a set of entities/documents or objects given a query entity/document or object, which is not necessarily the same type as the items in the set.

Use cases:

Information retrieval: ranking of sets of entities/documents or objects, e.g. ranking web documents.
Metric/similarity learning, e.g. learning sentence or document similarity.
Content-based or Collaborative filtering-based Recommendation, e.g. recommending music or videos.
Text classification, or any other labeling task.
Embedding graphs, e.g. multi-relational graphs such as Freebase.
