# Building H2O (H2O-3) Core Source Code #

Note: Make sure you have completed the [H2O Pre-requsite](https://github.com/Avkash/mldl/blob/master/pages/h2o_dw_prerequsite.md) requirements. 

Start: change your current working folder to H2O core - h2o-3 source code
```
$ pwd
/home/ubuntu/src/github/h2o/h2o-3
```

Now run the build command without the test (building test component will take very long so do it later)
```
$ ./gradlew build -x test
```
