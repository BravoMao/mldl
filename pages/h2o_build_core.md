# Building H2O (H2O-3) Core Source Code #

Note: Make sure you have completed the [H2O Pre-requsite](https://github.com/Avkash/mldl/blob/master/pages/h2o_dw_prerequsite.md) requirements. 

Start: change your current working folder to H2O core - h2o-3 source code
```
$ pwd
/home/ubuntu/src/github/h2o/h2o-3
```

Now run the build command without the test (building test component will take very long so do it later)
```
$ ./gradlew build -x test
```

```
:buildSrc:clean UP-TO-DATE
:buildSrc:compileJava FAILED

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':compileJava'.
> Could not find tools.jar
```
**Solution:**
```
1. Make sure you have following both commands working:
  $ java
  $ javac
  
If no javac then install openjdk:

  $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk

You must set JAVA_HOME environment because gradle is not able to find tools.jar and looking for JAVA_HOME 

$ echo $JAVA_HOME
  /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64

```
