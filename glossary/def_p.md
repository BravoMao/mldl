Pooling Layers | 
___
**Pooling Layers**:
Pooling is nothing other than down sampling of an image. It again helps the processor to process things faster. There are many pooling techniques. One is max pooling where we take largest of the pixel values of a segment. Mean pooling, Avg pooling are also done. Instead of the largest pixel, we calculate mean and avg.

Pooling works very much like convoluting, where we take a kernel and move the kernel over the image, the only difference is the function that is applied to the kernel and the image window isn’t linear.Max pooling and Average pooling are the most common pooling functions. Max pooling takes the largest value from the window of the image currently covered by the kernel, while average pooling takes the average of all values in the window.
