### Dataflow Graph ###
A data-flow graph (DFG) is a graph which represents a data dependancies between a number of operations. Any algorithm consists of a number of ordered operations. In a data flow graph, nodes are computations that send and receive data messages. Some nodes may only send messages, others may only receive messages, and others may send messages in response to messages that they receive.
- Ex: Tensorflow, Theano, Torch, Caffe
- Dataflow graph computing
   - Imperative
     - An API interface like numpy
     - Based on NDArray - Holds a tensor (multi dimension array)
     - Stores a pointer about where the memory is
   - Symbolic
     - An API interface lets user define computation graph like Tensorflow/Theano
