## L1 and L2 regularization ##

Regularization is a very important technique in machine learning to prevent overfitting. Mathematically speaking, it adds a regularization term in order to prevent the coefficients to fit so perfectly to overfit.  

## Difference between L1 and L2 regularization ##

The difference between the L1 and L2 is just that L2 is the sum of the square of the weights, while L1 is just the sum of the weights.

| L2 regularization    |  L1 regularization    | 
|:-------------------- | ------------------:|
|Computational effieient due to having analyticlsl solutions  |Computational inefficient on non-sparse cases   |
|Non-sparse outputs   | Sparse Outputs  |
| No feature selection | Built-feature selection
