Cross-validation | 


**Cross-validation (CV)**: Cross-validation is a technique to evaluate predictive models by partitioning the original sample into a training set to train the model, and a test set to evaluate it. In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal size subsamples. 
 - Depending on K, you will be traning models on that many time.  
 - You can use k-fold cross-validation in place of validation dataset, when you have smaller dataset and does not want to partition
