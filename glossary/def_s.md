### Skewed Data ###
In probability theory and statistics, skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive or negative, or undefined. The qualitative interpretation of the skew is complicated and unintuitive.
- Negative Skew > Tail is on left
- Positive Skew > Tail is on right
- Normal Distribution has no skew.Â  Symmetry is consider as normal..

You can build histogram with 0 included to see the tail clearly..

If data is skewed, its good to models in the following order and use grid search + hyper-parameter. 
 - 1. Generalized Linear Models
 - 2. Random Forest and GBM
 - 3. Multilayer perceptron
